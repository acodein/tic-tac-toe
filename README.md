# tic-tac-toe

## This project helped me to understand a little about factory functions , closures and IIFE (module pattern).

This project made me feel how a real world website can be.

## About:

    This project is a tic tac toe game where you start playing as X and the second player as O then if you get three Xs or Os in a line the data shows you win.

### right now there is little module pattern present i will change it later to make it more modulish.
